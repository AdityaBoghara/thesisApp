<h1>The <b>Three </b>Little <i>Pig</i></h1>

<p>
  He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.
  The second little pig worked a <i>little</i> bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of
  sticks.
  Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
  The third little pig worked <b>hard all day and built his house with bricks. </b></p>
<p>
  It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney.
  It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.
  The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived;
  and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside.
  He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.
  So he knocked on the door and said:
</p>
<p>
  Little pig! Little pig!
  Let me in! Let me in!
</p>
<p> But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:

  No! No! No!
  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!
</p>
<p>
  Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:
  Then I'll huff and <b>I'll puff and I'll blow your house down</b>. So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house
  down!
  The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away
  to hide with the second little pig. The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of
  sticks; and he saw the house, and he <i>smelled the pigs inside</i>, and his mouth began to water as he thought about
  the
  fine dinner they would make. So he knocked on the door and said: Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in! But
  the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back: </p>
<p>
  No! No! No!
  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!

  So the wolf showed his teeth and said:

  Then I'll huff
  and I'll puff
  and I'll blow your house down!
</p>
<p>
  So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at
  once,
  but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs
  scrambled away as fast as their <b>little</b> hooves would carry them.
  The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the
  door <i>closed before the wolf could catch </i>them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the
  wolf
  wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large
  appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little
  pigs would make a lovely feast.
  So the wolf knocked on the door and said:
  Little pigs! Little pigs!
  Let me in! Let me in!
</p>
<p>
  But the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:

  No! No! No!
  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!
</p>
<p>
  So the wolf showed his teeth and said:

  Then I'll huff
  and I'll puff
  and I'll blow your house down.

  Well! he huffed and he <i>puffed</i>. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he
  could
  not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So
  he
  stopped to rest and thought a bit.
  But this was too much. <b>The wolf danced about with</p>
<p> rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up
  the
  little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put
  on
  a big pot full of water to boil. <i>Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, </i>the little piggy
  pulled
  off
  the
  lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.
  So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.
