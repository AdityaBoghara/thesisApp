<p>Once upon a time, there was a poor orphan boy called Dick
  Whittington. The people in his village believed that the streets of
  London were paved with gold. So Dick decided to travel there and
  become a rich man.</p>
<p>Dick walked for many days, but when he arrived in London there were
  no streets of gold! Tired and hungry, he fell asleep on the steps of a
  great house.</p>
<p>The house belonged to a rich businessman who found Dick and gave him a job cleaning the kitchen.</p>
