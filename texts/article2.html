<p>Our solar system is made up the sun, eight planets, more than 150 moons, as well as comets, asteroids, <i>dwarf
    planets</i>
  and other space rocks.</p>

<p>Planets, asteroids and comets orbit the <i>sun</i>. They travel around our sun in an <b>ellipse</b>. It takes
  Mercury, the nearest
  planet, only 88 days but Neptune 164 years to travel around the sun once.</p>

<p>Moons <b>orbit</b> planets. Currently, Jupiter has the most moons â€“ over 60. Mercury and Venus don't have any moons.
</p>

<p>The <i>inner planets</i> Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars are called <b>terrestrial</b> planets. This means they
  have a
  hard
  <b>surface</b> to stand on. Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus are the <i>outer planets</i>. They are also called
  the gas
  giants
  because you can't stand on them - their <b>surface</b> is made of gas.
</p>

<p>There are many theories on how the solar system <b>developed</b>. About 4.5 <b>billion</b> years ago a big
  <b>cloud</b> of
  gas and
  <b>dust</b>
  probably <b>collapsed</b>. The sun formed in the middle, the <b>densest</b> region. Further away from the sun, gases
  changed
  to
  planets made of rock.
