    <i>NASA</i> has <b>discovered</b> the eighth planet of a star system, <b>similar</b> to our <i>solar system</i>. The
    star, Kepler-90 is over 2,500 <b>light years</b> away and larger and hotter than <i>our sun</i>. It is the first
    star
    known to have as many planets as our solar system.
</p>
<p>
    The Kepler-90 star system is much more <b>compact</b> than our solar system. The <b>outermost</b> planet orbits the
    star at about
    the
    same <b>distance</b> as the earth <b>orbits</b> the sun. its inner planets are small and <b>rocky</b> while the
    outer ones are larger and
    made up of gas.

<p>
    The newly discovered planet, Kepler -90i, is the third <b>celestial</b> object in the star system. It is probably
    rocky and
    similar to our earth, but because of its <b>closeness</b> to its home star has an <b>average surface temperature</b>
    of about 400Â°
    C.
    It moves around the star once every 14.4 days.
