    <i>NASA</i> has <b>discovered</b> the eighth planet of a star system, <b>similar</b> to our <i>solar system</i>. The
    star, Kepler-90 is over 2,500 <b>light years</b> away and larger and hotter than <i>our sun</i>. It is the first
    star
    known to have as many planets as our solar system.

<p>
    The Kepler-90 star system is much more <b>compact</b> than our solar system. The <b>outermost</b> planet orbits the
    star at about
    the
    same <b>distance</b> as the earth <b>orbits</b> the sun. its inner planets are small and <b>rocky</b> while the
    outer ones are larger and
    made up of gas.
